# Python Neo4j Graph Workflow

Python and Neo4j/Aura workflow for graph construction, export, and interactive HTML visualization.

This repository organizes the project into two complementary parts:

- **Part I:** graph generation and export using Python only
- **Part II:** Neo4j Aura integration inside the Python API, including graph retrieval and filtering outputs

## Workflow overview

The following scheme summarizes the full workflow used in this repository, from the Python-only graph construction to the Aura-integrated workflow.

## Part I: Python part

This first part corresponds to the **Python-only workflow**, where the graph is built and exported directly from Python.

### Main notebook
- `notebooks/Graph-categorical-final.ipynb`

### Generated files
- `graph_just_python.html` – interactive HTML graph generated from the Python workflow
- `exports/neo4j_import_python.cypher` – Cypher script for graph import
- `exports/nodes_python.csv` – exported node table
- `exports/relationships_python.csv` – exported relationship table

### Description
In this stage, the graph is created locally in Python and exported in multiple formats. The HTML file provides an interactive visualization of the generated graph, while the CSV and Cypher files allow import into Neo4j-compatible environments.

### Interactive output
[Open the Python-generated graph](graph_just_python.html)

GitHub may not render the interactive HTML file directly in the repository preview. For full interactivity, download the file and open it locally in a web browser.

## Part II: Aura inside Python API

This second part corresponds to the **Neo4j Aura workflow inside Python**, where Python connects to Aura, fetches graph elements, and generates additional interactive and filtered outputs.

### Main notebooks
- `notebooks/Neo4j-FINAL-organized.ipynb`
- `notebooks/Filter-interface.ipynb`

### Generated files
- `aura_within_python.html` – interactive HTML graph generated from the Aura-connected workflow
- `exports/cypher_fetch_used.cypher` – Cypher query used to fetch graph data
- `exports/nodes_fetched.csv` – fetched nodes exported from Aura
- `exports/rels_fetched.csv` – fetched relationships exported from Aura

### Description
In this stage, Python interacts directly with Neo4j Aura through the API. The workflow retrieves nodes and relationships, exports them as CSV and Cypher-based outputs, and generates an additional interactive HTML visualization. The filtering notebook is used to refine and inspect the graph after data retrieval.

### Interactive output

GitHub may not render the interactive HTML file directly in the repository preview. For full interactivity, download the file and open it locally in a web browser.

## Notebooks summary

### `Graph-categorical-final.ipynb`
Builds the graph structure in Python and exports the initial visualization and import files.

### `Neo4j-FINAL-organized.ipynb`
Connects Python to Neo4j Aura, queries the graph, and exports retrieved graph objects and visualization files.

### `Filter-interface.ipynb`
Provides the filtering and inspection interface for the Aura-based graph workflow.

## How to use

1. Open the notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder.
2. Run the notebook corresponding to the workflow you want:
   - `Graph-categorical-final.ipynb` for the Python-only workflow
   - `Neo4j-FINAL-organized.ipynb` for the Aura-integrated workflow
   - `Filter-interface.ipynb` for filtering and inspection
3. Open the generated HTML files locally in your browser to explore the interactive graph outputs.
4. Use the CSV and Cypher files in `exports/` for downstream analysis or Neo4j import.

## Notes

- The figure `Marius-scheme-Update.jpg` provides a visual summary of the two-part workflow.
- The HTML files are included as illustrative interactive outputs.
- The CSV and Cypher files document the graph structure both before and after Aura integration.
